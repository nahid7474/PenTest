Project Summary
----------------------------------------------------------
This project leverages Nmap within Kali Linux for a basic penetration testing reconnaissance.  
In this project, I will create a test virtualized private network with my three VMs and perform scanning of TCP and UDP ports, unveils potential vulnerabilities and identifies open services.



For this demonstration, I will use my 3 VMs (2 windows and 1 Kali Linux), keep them under the same private network and verify they can talk to each other. I will keep all my hosts on 192.168.56.0/24 network. To achieve my test scenario, first, I will change all my VM network as “Host-Only Adapter” by navigating through my Virtual box settings on each VM as per below.

VM settings -> Network ->Adapter 1-> Attached to ‘Host-only Adapter’ 
I will repeat this process for my two other windows machines as well.

Now that my VMs are having the same network setting, I will now verify that they are all under the same network, will start from my Kali Linux box, and run ‘ifconfig’ command on a new terminal and hit enter. 
The result below shows that my IP is 192.168.56.101, netmask is 24, which is expected result

Now I will head over to my 2nd  windows VM and run the ‘ipconfig/all’ command to verify the same.
The result below shows that my IP is 192.168.56.110, netmask is 24, which is expected result as well.

I will now head over to my 3rd  windows VM and run the same command
Got the similar result, shows that my IP is 192.168.56.111, netmask is 24. I have now verified that all my machines are on the same network.

To confirm these machines are reachable from one another, I will run ping command from both Kali machine and windows by calling the their Ips.

Results show that both devices can reach out to each other.

From my kali machine, I will now run a port scanning command targeting my windows machine to see what ports and services are open.

Results show that several ports are open.
I will now perform a comprehensive network on the target IP address by running the command “sudo nmap -p- -sV 192.168.56.111”.
This has provided me even more comprehensive results of what ports and services are open and listening for incoming connection.
